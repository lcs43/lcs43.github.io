<h2>A Low-Cost Water Measuring Device</h2>

<h2>Adapted from Guide M-226</h2>

<p class=aligncenter>Zohrab Samani, Associate Professor*<br>
Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</p>

<p>Measuring water in open channels is a basic element of water conservation. With the
increasing demand for improved water management techniques, there is a serious need for
low-cost and accurate water-measuring devices. Ever since the development of the Parshall
flume, attempts have been made to simplify the construction and improve the accuracy of
water-measuring devices in open channels. </p>

<p>The circular flume is an appropriate device for measuring flow through furrows because
its circular shape fits to the natural shape of a furrow, reducing the possibility of
lateral flow around the flume. The device also has been used successfully in lined and
unlined canals. </p>

<p>High costs have prevented the use of water measuring flumes by growers. However,
recently a practical water measuring device has been designed that can be used by growers
at low cost: the circular flume. </p>

<p>The circular flume is a simple device made of two pieces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipe, one installed vertically inside the other (fig. 1). The diameter of the inner column
should be approximate one-third of the flume's diameter (0.25 to 0.32). The inner column
reduces the cross-section of the flow, creating a critical flow condition. A gauge at the
upstream side of the inner column (figs. 1 and 2) measures the depth of the water upstream
of the critical flow section. </p>

<h3 class="alignleft">FLUME CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>The device is designed to create a critical flow by reducing the flow's cross-section.
A 2-ft length flume can be constructed from PVC pipes or a combination of PVC and
corrugated pipes. For small water courses such as furrow or small streams, flumes are
normally constructed from PVC pipes. For larger streams, where the availability of large
PVC pipe is limited, the flumes are constructed from a combination of corrugated metal
pipes and PVC pipes. </p>

<h4>1. Furrows and Small Streams (&lt; 100 gpm)</h4>

<p>To construct a simple circular flume for measuring flows in a furrow or in a small
stream, use a 2-ft section of 6&quot; nominal size schedule-40 PVC pipe and a 1-ft section
of 2&quot; schedule-40 PVC pipe. Cut a 2&quot; hole in the 6&quot; pipe, and install the
2&quot; pipe vertically inside the 6&quot; pipe. Install the vertical pipe 1.5 ft from the
entrance of the 6&quot; pipe (fig 1). Round the bottom end of the 2&quot; pipe so that it
can fit easily inside the 6&quot; pipe. Install a gauge at the upstream side of the inner
pipe to measure the depth of the flow. Cut a notch at the top of the 6&quot; pipe upstream
of the gauge to facilitate reading. Once flow depth is measured, flow rate can be
calculated using the calibration table. The depth of the water can also be measured inside
the 2&quot; pipe by a 0.5&quot; perforation at the top of the pipe. Measuring the flow
depth inside the 2&quot; pipe is preferable because it reduces fluctuation. If the flume
is installed in a dirt ditch or furrow, construct a cutoff sheet (2' x 2' sheet aluminum)
at the upstream end of the flume to avoid lateral water seepage. </p>

<h4>2. Circular Flume for Flow &gt; 100 gpm</h4>

<p>For higher flow rates in either dirt ditches or lined canals, make 4-ft-long flumes
with vertical column installed 3 ft downstream of the flume entrance. Install a gauge to
measure the flow depth at the upstream side of the vertical pipe. The flow depth can also
be measured inside the vertical pipe by creating a 1&quot; perforation on the upstream
side at the bottom of the vertical pipe. Normally both the gauge and perforation are used,
the gauge for direct observation and point measurement, the perforation for continuous
depth measurement inside the column using a float chart or a data logger. For flumes
larger than 24&quot;, construct the main pipe from 16 gauge corrugated metal pipe and the
column pipe from PVC.<a href="inexpensive_flume_information2.htm" target="_figure"> Tables 1-4 are
calibration tables for 6-12-18- and 36-inch flumes, respectively</a>. </p>

<h3 class="alignleft">SUBMERGENCE</h3>
<p>For proper operation, the flume should be submerged at a minimum level where the depth
of the water downstream of the column divided by the depth of the flow at the gauge is
less than 0.85. If this ratio is more than 0.85, raise the flume enough to reduce this
ratio. </p>
